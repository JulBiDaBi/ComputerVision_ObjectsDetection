### Purpose:
#### The aim of this project is to implement an object detection task using a YOLO model.

#### Issues

Traders and investors need to quickly and accurately analyze chart patterns in real-time stock trading video data to make informed decisions.

#### Solution

The YOLOv8s detection model, based on the YOLO framework, automates this analysis by detecting and classifying various stock market patterns in real time. It integrates with live trading systems, offering instant detection of patterns such as “Head and Shoulders Low”, “Head and Shoulders High”, “M_Head”, “StockLine”, “Triangle” and “W_Bottom”. This enables traders to optimize their strategies and react quickly to market trends.
